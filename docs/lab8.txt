§1.  Grammar cleaup
This section discusses the changes we made to our grammar following lab 7. §1.1 came from Dr. Bender's lab comments, while the rest came from things we learned while trying to translate between English, Pite Saami, and Dagaare.


§1.1.  Our lab 7 grammar was overgenerating on sentences like the following by including wh-int-cl when there was no Wh word. This was resolved by identifying cop-lex's ARG-ST value with its SUBJ and COMPS and making adj-lex inherit from norm-zero-arg:

    zenɛ  a   tontone-V waa la   belaa
    today DEF worker-PL  be  FACT few
    'today the workers are few'

    cop-lex := basic-verb-lex-super & trans-first-arg-raising-lex-item-2 & non-mod-lex-item &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CAT.VAL [ SUBJ < #subj & [ LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX #xarg,
                                                          CAT cat-sat &
                                                            [ VAL [ SPR < >,
                                                                    COMPS < > ],
                                                              HEAD noun ] ] ] >,
                                 COMPS < #comps & [ LOCAL.CAT cat-sat &
                                   [ HEAD.PRD +,
                                     VAL [ SUBJ < >,
                                     COMPS < > ] ] ] >,
                                 SPR < >,
                                 SPEC < > ],
                        CONT.HOOK.XARG #xarg ],
         ARG-ST < #subj, #comps > ].

    adj-lex := basic-intersective-adjective-lex & norm-zero-arg &
      [ INFLECTED.NUMBER-FLAG - ].


§1.2.  In the previous lab, we were not able to get Dagaare's focus particle, la, to appear in translations. In this lab, we were able to get la to appear by modifying a trigger rule that had been generated by the matrix (see below). The matrix provided two trigger rules, one for verbs and one for nouns, but since our experience indicates that noun focus is more marked, we chose to only activate the verb trigger rule. As is, incoming sentences are able to be translated with and without the particle, which is not correct for Dagaare: in general, non-negative sentences are required to have the focus particle. Time and complexity restrictions prevented us from enforcing this constraint.

    la-marker-v_gr := arg0e_gtr &
      [ CONTEXT.RELS <! [ ARG0.SF prop-or-ques ] !>,
        FLAGS.TRIGGER "la-marker-v" ].


§1.3.  Dagaare has Wh questions which are indicated with a Wh word, and yes/no questions which are indicated with the question particle, bee. These items are supposed to be in complementary distribution, but translation showed us that Wh-questions were allowed to have the question particle attached. The solution was to create a new feature on the verb type so that the wh-int-cl phrase rule could use it to let other rules know that it had applied; we then specified that the type that the question particle inherits from must have a complement that hadn't gone through a Wh rule.

    verb :+ [ WH bool ].

    wh-int-cl := clause & head-compositional & head-only &
      [ SYNSEM [ LOCAL.CAT [ VAL #val,
                             HEAD.WH +,
                             MC bool ]
    ...

    qpart-lex-item := complementizer-lex-item &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX.SF ques,
                       CAT [ VAL.COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL.CAT [ MC +,
                                                         HEAD [ FORM finite,
                                                                WH - ] ],
                             HEAD.INIT - ] ] ].


§1.4.  We discovered that in negative sentences, our grammar identified the index of the sentence with the index of the negation predicate, instead of the index of the main verb. To resolve this, we modified the type that the negative auxiliaries inherit from to pass up the index of their complement, instead of their own:

    subj-raise-aux-with-pred := subj-raise-aux & trans-first-arg-raising-lex-item-1 & norm-ltop-lex-item & single-rel-lex-item &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL [ CONT.HOOK.INDEX #ind,
                       CAT.VAL.COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX #ind ] ].


§1.5.  Dagaare has tense auxiliaries, but in the initial setup with the matrix, we mistakenly specified that the tense should be specified on the auxiliary, instead of its complement, and that the auxiliary should have a tense predicate. We resolved this by going back to the matrix and comparing its output against output generated from our last choices file. Along with the predicate deletions from the lexicon, the changes the matrix made to dagaare.tdl are as follows:

    subj-raise-aux-no-pred := subj-raise-aux & raise-sem-lex-item &
      [ ARG-ST < [ ],
                 [ LOCAL.CAT.HEAD.AUX bool ] > ].

    past-aux-lex := subj-raise-aux-no-pred &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL [ CAT.HEAD.FORM nonfinite,
                                                 CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.TENSE past ] ].

    fut-aux-lex := subj-raise-aux-no-pred &
      [ SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL [ CAT.HEAD.FORM nonfinite,
                                                 CONT.HOOK.INDEX.E.TENSE future ] ].


§1.6.  Because a large number of the target sentences required handling of English's object-dropping 'eat,' we decided to implement object drop in Dagaare. This appears to be in line with the facts of the language, as illustrated below.

    a   bal-V    ba  di-ro    lɛnso
    DEF puppy-SG NEG eat-IPFV well
    'The puppy does not eat well'
    (Grimm 2017)

To implement object drop, we went through the matrix, which only made the following addition to rules.tdl:

    basic-head-opt-comp := basic-head-opt-comp-phrase.

However, this introduced two issues: the first was that it wasn't quite enough to get Dagaare to translate English sentences, and the second was that the focus particle was allowed to attach both above and below the basic-head-opt-comp rule. Both of these issues were resolved by modifying the basic-head-opt-comp-phrase like so:

    basic-head-opt-comp-phrase :+
      [ SYNSEM.LIGHT -,
        HEAD-DTR.SYNSEM.LOCAL.CAT.VAL.COMPS.FIRST.LOCAL.CONT.HOOK.INDEX.COG-ST type-id ].

The first issue was resolved by specifying LIGHT -, which conflicts with the specification on the type la inherits from. This ensures that the focus marker is only added below basic-head-opt-comp-phrase, and is consistent with the facts of the language, which suggests that in a transitive sentence, the focus marker attaches to the verb before the verb's complement.

    Source: a
    Judgment: g
    baa-ri di  la  a   baa-ri
    dog-PL eat FOC DEF dog-PL
    'dogs eat dogs'

    Source: a
    Judgment: u
    *baa-ri di  a   baa-ri la
    dog-PL  eat DEF dog-PL FOC
    'dogs eat dogs

The second issue came from the COG-ST value being underspecified on verbs whose objects were dropped; this conflicted with English, which specifies type-id. We added the same specification to Dagaare to enable the languages to communicate.


§2.  Translation
Our Dagaare grammar was able to translate 14/23 of the sentences for English and 14/21 of the Pite Saami sentences. To achieve this, we had to make one small modification to Dagaare's lexicon (§2.1). For whatever reason, be it that Dagaare is an SVO language like English and/or that Dagaare is an isolating language, we did not need to implement any transfer rules between English and Dagaare or Pite Saami and Dagaare in order to achieve the results that we did.

Our grammar gives multiple expected translations for many sentences; §2.2 describes extra translations that Dagaare should get from any input, §2.3 describes extra translations from languages like English, and §2.3 describes extra translations Dagaare gets from languages like Pite Saami. Finally, §2.5 describes some lingering problems with our translations.


§2.1.  Modifications to Dagaare
Like French, Dagaare does not have an adjective that means 'hungry'; instead, the way to express the same idea is to say that one 'has hunger'. We are very proud of the work we have done with Dagaare's adjectives (albeit with much credit going to Dr. Bender), and trying to include 'has hunger' in the way the translation sentences need it would require implementation of relative clauses, so we chose to make foor 'empty' translate to 'hungry' for the purposes of this lab.


§2.2.  Multiple translations in general
There are two sources of extra tranlsations in our grammar. As mentioned in §1.2, we were not able to constrain Dagaare sentences to require the focus particle, so any number of successful translations are automatically doubled - one with the focus particle, and one without. Since the grammatical sentences are the ones with the focus particle, it is those that are given in MMT_gur.txt.

Dagaare has a constrast between strong and weak nominal pronouns, and we were unable to find a satisfactory description of exactly how they differ. As such, we have left them unconstrained, such that any time a nominative pronoun is translated into Dagaare, two translations will result. The weak pronouns seem to be the less marked of the two, so those are included in MMT_gur.txt.


§2.3  Multiple translations from English
Dagaare only gets one extra translation from English, and that is when the second person pronoun is being translated from English. English does not constrain its second person pronoun for number, while Dagaare does. We arbitrarily chose the second person singular pronoun for use in our MMT_gur.txt.


§2.4.  Multiple translations from Pite Saami
Pite Saami appears to leave definiteness unconstrained, while Dagaare does not. Nouns preceeded by the definite article, 'a', are definite, and nouns not preceeded by 'a' are indefinite. This means that every noun phrase translated into Dagaare from Pite Saami results in two different translations; multiple noun phrases in a sentence result in exponential numbers of translations.


§2.5.  Remaining translation problems
There are a number of phenomena that our grammar was not able to cover to due lack of resources this term; those include interrogative complements and a lexical entry for 'after'. In these cases, we have indicated "no translation" in our MMT_gur.txt file. We have also come across a few more specific issues with translations:

English 'dogs eat quickly' results in extra parses because adjectives appear to be having the same issue with object drop that the focus particle did. This is clearly an issue with our grammar, likely with a similar solution to the focus issue, requiring modification of the LIGHT feature somewhere. As of time of submission, we have not been able to identify such a solution.

Pite Saami /bednaga haoskaoli bijlajd ja gaahto haoskaoli bednagajd/ 'dogs chase cars and cats chase dogs' yields a very large number of translations. There are four nouns and two coordinated clauses, so we already expect at least 2^6 translations, but there is more going on, such as the question particle appearing and the focus particle appearing at the beginning of the sentence. The equivalent sentence does not translate at all when coming from English, so this may have something to do with the interaction of all three grammars.

The following sentences do not translate into Dagaare. With each sentence is a brief idea of why this might be, if one is known to us.

__Both__
the dogs dont chase cars
We have a rule in semi.vpm that maps present tense to no-tense, since default sentences are underspecified for tense. However, this conflicts with Dagaare's negative auxiliaries, which are specified for tense.

I think that you know that dogs chase cars
We were unable to investigate the source of this issue due to time constraints.

What do you think the dogs chase
We were unable to investigate the source of this issue due to time constraints.

I asked what the dogs chased
We have not implemented interrogative complements in Dagaare.

Who asked what the dogs chase
We have not implemented interrogative complements in Dagaare.

__English only__
I ask whether you know that dogs chase cars
This likely has similarities to the issue(s) in the previous sentence, in addition to the fact that we were not able to implement interrogative complements.

dogs chase cars and cats chase dogs
We were unable to investigate the source of this issue due to time constraints. Pite Saami also has issues with this sentence, but it does at least translate.

cats chase dogs and sleep
We were unable to investigate the source of this issue due to time constraints, but this sentence along with the previous sentence suggests there is an issue with sentential coordination. Given more time, we would look into the fix Dr. Bender demonstrated in class concerning coordination in other languages.

the dog sleeps after the cat sleeps
We were unable to find an example of 'after,' and given that Dagaare sometimes uses coordination in situations like this, we were reluctant to speculate.

__Pite Saami only__

dogs eat quickly
We were unable to investigate the source of this issue due to time constraints. English also has issues with this sentence, but it does at least translate.


§3. Coverage
Inclusion of object dropping caused us to re-evaluate the grammaticality of some test items which we had previously marked as ungrammatical. For this reason, our lab 7 baseline numbers are lower than reported in lab 7.

      | Coverage | Overgeneration
------+----------+----------------
lab 7 | 70.6%    | 40.8%
lab 8 | 74.1%    | 36.7%
